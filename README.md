# Requser Project

This project is a user management application where users can be listed, edited, and deleted. The backend is powered by Next.js API routes, and the frontend is a React-based user interface.

## Assumptions and Considerations

- The application uses Next.js for both frontend and backend logic.
- User data is fetched from and updated through an API. The app allows for creating, updating, and deleting users.
- For storing user data in a production environment, you might need to set up a proper database or replace the mock API with a real one.
- The app uses `next-auth` for authentication (if included in the actual project setup).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (npm comes with Node.js)
